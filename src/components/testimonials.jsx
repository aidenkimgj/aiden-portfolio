                    “I had the pleasure of having Aiden Kim in two of my classes
                    last year in the Information Technology program Software
                    Development major at SAIT. Aiden prided himself in the work
                    he produced and his assessment submissions were always very
                    high calibre and always demonstrated his strong
                    comprehension of the subject matter. Aiden worked very well
                    independently which was vital when we switched to a remote
                    delivery environment, but demonstrated his strong and
                    positive team skills when working collaboratively with his
                    group in the fourth semester database course.”
